# JJ Configuration Notes

Maybe there's a way to change this, but jujutsu looks for its config inside the /Users/woody/Library/Application Support/jj directory. I'd like to store this in .config files like all of the other main tools, so I had to create a symlink from the ~/.config/jj repo to the jj directory in Application Support.
